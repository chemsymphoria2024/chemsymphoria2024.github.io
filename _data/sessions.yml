  title: "Probing nucleic acid architecture and function using responsive nucleoside"
  description: "DNA and RNA polymerases and nucleotide transferases are widely used in
    introducing functionalities that aid in the structural and functional analysis of nucleic acids.
    This process greatly relies on the ability of native and engineered enzymes to incorporate
    functionalized nucleotides into oligonucleotides. While polymerases can process a wide
    variety of structurally diverse nucleotide substrates, currently available data does not provide
    an adequate understanding of the underlying mechanism that enables the enzyme to accept
    such unnatural nucleotides. For a decade now, we have been developing microenvironment-
    sensitive nucleoside/nucleotide analogs that help in probing the structure and ligand binding
    properties of therapeutically relevant nucleic acid motifs. We have leveraged the
    microenvironment sensitivity of C5-heterocycle-modified dUTP substrates to probe the
    incorporation mechanism and chemical space tolerance of DNA polymerases. In this
    presentation, I will describe the development of a probe platform using our dual-functional
    nucleotide probes to study the polymerase activity in real time and at the atomic level by using
    a combination of fluorescence, 19F NMR and X-ray crystallography techniques. The findings
    from our studies further expand the limited knowledge on the interplay between the
    polymerases and chemically diverse substrates, and build a basis for developing nucleotide
    probes for advanced applications."

  title: "Unveiling Temperature-Induced Structural Phase Transition and Luminescence in Mn2+-Doped Cs2NaBiCl6 Double Perovskite"
  description: "Doping metal ions into halide double perovskites introduces intriguing optical and optoelectronic properties.
   However, the double perovskites undergo structural phase transitions under varying temperature and pressure, raising questions 
   about how such transitions affect the dopant's optoelectronic behavior. Also, can the dopants alter the phase transition behavior?
    Here we address these questions, with the example of Mn2+-doped Cs2NaBiCl6 double perovskite.1 Both the undoped and Mn2+-doped
     Cs2NaBiCl6 show a similar structural phase transition below 110 K. The samples remain in cubic phase between 300-110 K, 
     transitioning to a tetragonal phase between 100-15 K. Importantly, this phase transition of the host does not influence 
     the photoluminescence (PL) arising from Mn2+ d-d transitions. Similarly, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of Mn2+
      dopants remain unchanged across the phase transition temperature. Both the PL and EPR data suggest that the local structure around 
      Mn2+ dopant remains unchanged, ensuring a stable light emission, regardless of the transition of global structure of the host. 
      These results suggest that the global structural phase transition of the host does not to influence the local structure and emission
       property of the dopant Mn2+ ion. The stability of dopant emission regardless of the structural phase transition bodes well
        for their potential applications in phosphor converted light emitting diodes."

  title: "Sulfation Patterns of Fluorinated Heparan Sulfate Encode Unprecedented Molecular Recognitions and Activities"
  description: "Heparan sulfate (HS) are heterogenous polysaccharide that contributes to diverse biological processes.
   However, the synthetic challenges, selective protein binding and stability within biological systems impede 
   medical applications of native HS ligands. In contrast, HS mimetics have emerged as a powerful tool in drug
    discovery. Herein, we present the design and synthesis of the first series of HS mimetics composed of 
    fluorine atom at the C3 position of the glucuronic acid residue, aimed at modulating structure-activity 
    relationships. The 19F-NMR confirmed that fluorine peaks are high sensitive to the sulfation patterns and
     maintained the 4C1 conformation in glucuronic acid.  While, the microarray analysis, followed by SPR 
     studies confirmed a single site substitution (OH to F) in HS drastically improve the N-acetate HS sequence
      binding affinity towards growth factors and chemokines. To our surprise,  GlcNAc6S-GlcA(3F) and
       GlcuNS6S3S-GlcA(3F) showed remarkable strong binding to various growth factors and chemokines similar 
       to highly sulfate N-sulfate native HS ligands. Further, these binding also regulate growth factors 
       mediated fibroblast cells proliferation, demonstrating the importance of F-substitution in HS to 
       modulate its activity"

  title: "Metabolomic insights into the development of hyperglycemia in murine models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus"
  description: "
Background: The incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is increasing at alarming proportions worldwide. 
This necessitates the need to gain deeper insights into the establishment and development of the disease. 
Amongst the two major forms of DM, type 1 DM (T1DM) is autoimmune and involves the death of pancreatic -cells, 
while type 2 DM (T2DM) is associated with the development of insulin resistance. The development of murine models
 for both T1DM and T2DM has helped in elucidating disease mechanisms and in assessing the efficacy of various 
 therapeutic agents. However, a dire need exists to identify early biomarkers for the two. Metabolomics, the 
 study of metabolites the end-products of different biochemical pathways, has emerged as a major tool for the
  identification of specific and early biomarkers. This study is an attempt in this direction where a relationship 
  between the development of hyperglycemia and metabolic disturbances that occur during the development of type 1 
  diabetes (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is being evaluated using established animal models.
Methods: Male C57BL/6 mice, aged six weeks, were subjected to streptozotocin (STZ) injections (55 mg/kg) in 
increasing numbers (0 to 5 injections). Mice were monitored for 15- and 60-day post-injection for T1DM development. 
For T2DM, eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fructose/high-fat diet (HF/HFD), with assessments 
at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) were performed 
to confirm the development of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. Following these assessments, NMR spectroscopy
 was performed on the metabolites extracted from the collected adipose tissue samples. Briefly, 1H NMR spectra were
  recorded using the noesygppr1d pulse program. Metabolite concentrations were calculated for each adipose tissue
   sample using Chenomx NMR Suite 8.1 software. The normalized metabolite concentrations were analyzed using 
   MetaboAnalyst to determine and identify the significantly perturbed metabolites.
Results: Mice receiving three or more STZ injections exhibited significant hyperglycemia at both the early 
and late time points, indicating that small insults were adequate for inducing diabetic conditions. In the HF/HFD
 cohort, a progressive increase in insulin resistance and hyperglycemia was observed from 8 weeks onwards. 
 A total of 51 abundant and aqueous metabolites were identified in the adipose tissues, with leucine and lysine 
 emerging as potential early biomarkers for pancreatic β-cell death in T1DM. For T2DM, metabolites such as choline, 
 glycerophosphocholine, and valine showed promise as early biomarkers for establishing hyperglycemia and insulin 
 resistance. The common perturbed metabolic pathways included protein biosynthesis, propanoate metabolism, 
 and valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation.
Conclusion: The metabolic perturbations identified from this study provide insights into the pathophysiology 
of T1DM and T2DM and suggest specific metabolites that can be proposed as potential early biomarkers for the 
identification of these conditions. Further exploration of these pathways may enhance understanding of diabetes 
progression and provide insights for different therapeutic strategies."

  title: "Effect of film morphology on circular dichroism of chiral hybrid perovskites"
  description: "Chiral hybrid perovskite films combine optical chirality with semiconducting charge transport 
  properties leading to chiral optoelectronics like circularly polarized photodetectors or LEDs. A key component 
  for such applications is the extent of chirality in the film. Circular dichroism (CD), particularly its 
  anisotropic factor (gCD), is typically used to measure the extent of chirality of the material. 
  In contrast, here we show that the CD and gCD depends strongly on an extrinsic parameter, namely film morpohology.
   We have prepared single crystals and spin-coated films of six chiral hybrid lead halides, 2D (R- and S-MBA)2PbI4,
    1D (R- and S-MBA)PbI3 and 1D (R- and S-MBA)PbBr3, where MBA = methylbenzylammonium. Four samples, 
    2D (R- and S-MBA)2PbI4 and 1D (R- and S-MBA)PbI3 form homogenous non-textured films, 
    and show isotropic CD signal with reliable gCD values. But other two samples, 1D 
    (R- and S-MBA)PbBr3 form textured films, showing uncorrelated CD signals from different
     parts of the same film. Therefore, our results show that the role of film morphology needs
      to be verified, before designing and comparing chiroptic and chiral optoelectronic properties 
      of hybrid perovskites."

  description: "Eosin-Y catalyzed synthesis of diverse arrays of bioactive tetraketones using 
  cyclic-1,3-diketones and tertiary amines as alkyl synthon under 18W blue LED have been accomplished. 
   Diverse arrays of tertiary amines first undergo reductive quenching of excited photo catalyst to form
    iminium ion that upon subsequent attack by cyclic-1,3-diketones give rise to tetraketones.
     The tetraketones were cyclised further using I2/K2CO3 to afford spirocyclic products."

  title: "Effect of Gauche and Anti Conformers on Chirality of 2D Layered Hybrid Perovskites"
  description: "Two-dimensional (2D) chiral organic-inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites 
  combines structural asymmetry, semiconducting charge transport and strong spin-orbit coupling paving 
  the way for unique chiral optoelectronic and spin-based properties. Typically, chiral organic sublattice
   induces chirality into the inorganic sublattice through non-covalent interactions at organic-inorganic 
   interface. However, the specific mechanisms driving this chirality induction remain unclear. In a novel 
   approach, we propose using different conformers of a chiral organic ammonium ion to create asymmetry in 
   these non-covalent interactions, thereby tailoring the chirality of the inorganic sublattice. We prepared 
   (R-IAP)2PbI4 and (S-IAP)2PbI4 (IAP: 1-iodopropane-2-ammonium), which crystallize in the helical 
   enantiomorphic space groups P43212 and P41212, respectively. Structural analysis shows that the 
   gauche- and anti-conformers of IAP are arranged alternatively in the hybrid structure. Importantly, 
   the anti-conformer of IAP ion have significantly stronger electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, 
   and I-I halogen bonding interactions with the inorganic [PbI4] sublattice, compared to the 
   gauche-conformer. This periodic asymmetry in non-covalent interactions caused by the alternative 
   arrangement of gauche- and anti-conformers, induces chirality within the inorganic sublattice lattice,
    marked by rare four-fold screw axes (4₃ and 4₁). The two chiral enantiomers (R-/S-IAP)2PbI4 
    show mirror-image like circular dichroism spectra for excitonic absorption, which originates 
    mainly from the inorganic sublattice. This conformer-mediated approach to design chiral hybrid 
    perovskites in helical space groups expands the materials options for advanced optoelectronics. "

  title: "Mn (III) Catalyzed Synthesis of New Chroman and Chromeno-quinoline Molecules via 
  Trans-annulation of  4-hydroxy Coumarins Using 2-hydroxy / Amino Benzyl Alcohols"
  description:   "Abstract: The chemistry of heterocyclic compounds holds a significant role in
   modern organic and medicinal chemistry. These heterocyclic compounds serve as key
    structural frameworks in various biologically active compounds. Moreover, 2H-chromene
     derivatives with oxygen-containing heterocycles exhibit a range of pharmacological effects.
      2H-chromenes serve as precursors for creating various therapeutic agents, such as anti-HIV, 
      antidiabetic, anticancer, antihypertensive, antioxidative, and antiviral. Additionally, they 
      are utilized in the development of antitumor, antimicrobial, fungicidal, insecticidal, and 
      cytotoxic substances, and play a key role as intermediates in the synthesis of many natural 
      products and pharmaceuticals. The synthesis of 2H-chromene derivatives typically involves the 
      condensation of phenols with α, β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, such as aldehydes or ketones. 
      One common method is the use of pechmann condensation, where a phenolic compound reacts with a 
      β-ketoester in the presence of an acid catalyst, leading to the formation of chromene molecule.
       Herein, we developed a new approach for the synthesis of novel chromene derivatives via trans-annulation
        of 4-hydroxy coumarins using 2-hydroxy or amino-substituted benzyl alcohols in the presence of most 
        abundant Mn (III) catalyst. The process typically involves dual C-H alkylation followed by ring opening 
        and annulation to access chroman or chromeno-quinoline derivatives. The mechanistic investigation was

  title: "Synthesis of Hybrid Amphiphilic Peptides to Inhibition of Aβ42 Aggregation"
  description: "shorter 10- and 12-mer peptides exhibited only minimal aggregation inhibition,
   while the fully hydrophobic 15-mer analogue of the ααγ-hybrid peptide showed no aggregation 
   inhibitory activity. Additionally, the ααγ-hybrid peptide demonstrated resistance to trypsin 
   digestion and proved nontoxic to neuronal cells. Circular dichroism analysis revealed that the
    peptide induces a helical conformation in Aβ42 upon interaction, which is a significant departure
     from the typical β-sheet conformation associated with Aβ42 aggregation. With increasing the 
     length of the peptide enhances its ability to disrupt Aβ42 aggregation while maintaining non-toxicity
      to cells and exhibiting non-hemolytic properties."

  title: "Heparin Neutralization Using Guanidine-Heparan Sulfate"
  description: "Heparin is a widely used anticoagulant in clinical settings, but its overuse or accidental 
  overdose can lead to serious bleeding complications. Protamine sulfate has long served as the standard antidote;
   however, its potential for adverse effects such as anaphylaxis and thrombocytopenia has prompted the search
    for safer, more efficient alternatives. In this study, we report the discovery of guanidine-based heparan
     sulfate mimetics as novel antidotes for heparin. Guanidine's strong basicity and capacity for electrostatic 
     interactions allow it to effectively bind to heparin's negatively charged sulfate groups, neutralizing its
      anticoagulant properties. By using structure-guided design, we synthesized and evaluated a series of 
      guanidine HS trisaccharides for their heparin-binding affinity and neutralization capacity. In vitro 
      assays demonstrated that guanidine compounds could rapidly neutralize various forms of heparin. 
      The binding mechanism was confirmed through NMR, which revealed strong electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding
       interactions between guanidine groups and heparin's sulfate chains. These findings suggest that guanidine
        HS represent a promising new class of heparin antidotes with potential advantages over protamine in terms 
        of safety, efficacy, and specificity. Further in vivo studies are warranted to explore their therapeutic
         applications and pharmacological profiles."

  title: "Phosphine Stabilized Low Valent Tetrylene"
  description: "The chemistry of the stable divalent Group 14 elements, called Tetrylene, has been the subject 
  of extensive discussion and investigation for the past several decades. Tetrylenes, being the heavier analouge
   of carbene, have one lone pair of electrons and one vacant p orbital, hence, they require inter/intramolecular
    donation to provide thermodynamic stabilization.1 There are a lot of reports on the synthetic design and 
    reactivity of low valent Germanium ( Germylene) and Tin ( Stannylene).  Here, we designed a phosphine-stabilized
     Germylene and Stannylene in the Acenaphthene backbone. Interestingly, the electron push from the adjacent
      peri-substituted Phosphorous atom to the vacant p orbital of germylene and stannylene led to different 
      kinds of bond activations5 at the germylene center based on the donating ability of the Phosphine, 
      rendering the oxidation of the Germanium center from +2 to +4 oxidation state. However, when we placed 
      a Germanium (II) cation6 adjacent to the Germylene, the electron push from the phosphine and simultaneous 
      electron pull from the Ge (II) cation stabilized the Germylene via push-pull interaction.
In other work, we investigated the coordination of Gold(I) chloride with a PNNP pincer ligand provided 
promising results with the synthesis of a monometallic and a bimetallic complex. The monometallic complex 
provided an open coordination site which was further exploited for the coordination of low-valent germanium.
 However, that led to the formation of an unprecedented Germanium (II)  Gold (I) bimetallic complex."

  title: "Reactivity of acceptor-acceptor DIPOLs under visible light conditions : An access to pesticide analogues."
  description: "Pyrazolone framework has been greatly explored for various applications owing to their presence
   in many bioactive compounds. The novel reactivity of less selective and more reactive acceptor-acceptor
    kind of diazo pyrazolone (DIPOL) has been explored under visible light for the first time. We have 
    successfully demonstrated the reaction of DIPOL and different allyl thioethers under blue light to 
    construct a wide variety of products including pesticidal analogue exclusively in excellent chemo-selectivities
     in good to excellent yields. Moreover, the possible side products emanating from ketene were not observed. 
     This protocol works smoothly in environmentally benign solvent under inert free condition. The practicality 
     of the protocol has been extended to photo-flow reaction and also the reaction works smoothly under the

  title: "Click-functionalized aptamer platform to detect c-Met overexpressing cancer cells"
  description: "Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a natural protein that binds to its 
  high-affinity receptor, mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-Met) which then
   activates several downstream cellular signaling such as tissue regeneration, growth 
   and protection. overexpression of c-Met shows cancer metastasis. A DNA aptamer trcln3
    is known to bind to c-Met target-specifically and inhibit HGF-induced c-Met signaling.
     Our hypothesis is to conjugate the aptamer to a probe leveraging click chemistry. The
      modified aptamer attaches to the cell membrane by receptor binding and via receptor-mediated 
      endocytosis internalizes the probe attached at the 3’-end of the aptamer. This modified aptamer 
      can be used as a tool for cellular imaging as well as a targeted drug delivery platform. "
