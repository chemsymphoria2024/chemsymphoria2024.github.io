  title: "Welcome by the President"
  description: "The development of efficient and sustainable chemical processes is essential in addressing 
          the environmental challenges posed by industrial practices. This talk focuses on the
          pivotal role of catalysts in facilitating greener chemical reactions, particularly 
          in the context of energy conservation and waste minimization. We will delve into recent
          advancements in heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis, examining how these innovations 
          contribute to improved reaction rates and selectivity. Special attention will 
          be given to the design of new catalytic systems that enable the conversion
          of renewable feedstocks into valuable chemicals with reduced energy input."
