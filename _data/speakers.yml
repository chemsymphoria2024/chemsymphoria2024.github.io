  Mumbai. He was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Michigan before joining IISER Pune in 2013. 
  His lab focuses on various aspects of solution NMR spectroscopy, including theoretical design and 
  implementation of new NMR experiments to probe the biophysical characteristics and conformational 
  dynamics of RNAs, proteins, and RNA-protein complexes. In parallel, he is also interested in looking 
  at metabolic profiles of various body fluids (urine, blood, saliva, etc.) in normal and disease conditions 
  and cell extracts under various stressed conditions to understand and correlate the metabolic pathways 
  with specific phenotypes."
